Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.\n\nI need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?\n\nHey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.\n\nA tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. I find your lack of faith disturbing. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!\n\nYe-ha! You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! I'm trying not to, kid. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. I'm trying not to, kid. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.\n\nHokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.\n\nYou're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! Don't underestimate the Force. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? I find your lack of faith disturbing.\n\nI find your lack of faith disturbing. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.\n\nBut with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.\n\nI don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. I'm trying not to, kid.\n\nDantooine. They're on Dantooine. What?! I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly…\n\nWhat!? You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. I find your lack of faith disturbing.\n\nI need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. I'm trying not to, kid. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.\n\nI'm trying not to, kid. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.\n\nNo! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.\n\nEscape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. What!? You don't believe in the Force, do you? Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.\n\nObi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. I call it luck. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.\n\nWhat good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide. What?! The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.\n\nI call it luck. He is here. I find your lack of faith disturbing. You mean it controls your actions? I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.\n\nI care. So, what do you think of her, Han? Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going."
